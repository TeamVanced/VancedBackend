      "description": "Rakendusel YouTube Music Vanced on sama eesmärk kui YouTube Vancedil, kuid see rakendus keskendub YouTube Musicule. See on võrreldes Vanced'iga suhteliselt vähem funktsioonirikas, kuid sisaldab siiski paljusid asju, mida eeldate, nagu reklaamide blokeerimine ja taustal taasesitamine, kõik see YouTube Music Vancedi sisemuses!"

      "title": "Root ja Non-Root erinevus",
      "description": "#### Root:\nThe root variant of Vanced seamlessly replaces the official YouTube app. As a result, you can directly open YouTube links or call them using Google Assistant through the modded Vanced app.\n\n#### Non-Root:\n- If you have a device that is difficult to root, or you don’t want to root your daily device on first hand, you should opt for the non-root variant.\n- Since the package name of the non-root variant is different from the stock YouTube app, they can co-exist. Note that you need to install an additional companion app (Vanced microG) to be able to log in with your YouTube/Google account.\n- Moreover, you have to manually set Vanced as the default app for opening YouTube links.\n- However, the non-root variant is much simpler to install and use, so we recommend you stick with the non-root variant unless you really need to replace the stock YouTube app on your phone."
