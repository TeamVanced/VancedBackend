      "title": "Difference between Root and Non-Root",
      "description": "#### Root:\nThe root variant of Vanced seamlessly replaces the official YouTube app. As a result, you can directly open YouTube links or call them using Google Assistant through the modded Vanced app.\n\n#### Non-Root:\n- If you have a device that is difficult to root, or you donâ€™t want to root your daily device on first hand, you should opt for the non-root variant.\n- Since the package name of the non-root variant is different from the stock YouTube app, they can co-exist. Note that you need to install an additional companion app (Vanced microG) to be able to log in with your YouTube/Google account.\n- Moreover, you have to manually set Vanced as the default app for opening YouTube links.\n- However, the non-root variant is much simpler to install and use, so we recommend you stick with the non-root variant unless you really need to replace the stock YouTube app on your phone."
