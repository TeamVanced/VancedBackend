      "description": "Of course, Google won't allow a modified version of its own app to be on their store so don't look for it on the Google Play Store those are fake apps.\n\nVanced apps can be downloaded and installed using Vanced Manager which can be found on our official website: <https://vancedapp.com> but you can also grab it from [GitHub repo](https://github.com/YTVanced/VancedManager/releases/latest)"

      "description": "Vanced doesn't include any video downloading feature and never will.\n\nMany videos are available to download for free in [selected countries](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6141269). For the rest of the world, please get YouTube Premium.\n\nAgain, Vanced WILL NEVER add a video downloader to the app or anything similar.\n\nThis has been the reason for the shutdown of many YouTube mods in the past as Google doesn't like people downloading copyrighted content from their platform so don't ask for it!!!"

      "title": "Why using split APKs?",
      "description": "Because:\n\n1. The stock app uses it so Vanced uses it too.\n2. It only installs the languages you specify to reduce storage consumption.\n3. It has the only version of core APK that your device requires.\n\nOf course, the Vanced Manager or developers can convert it to a normal, single APK file, but we are so lazy to do it. You just need to get along with what we have...\n\nDon't worry though, Vanced Manager does all the hard work for you so just tap on the `Install` button."
