      "description": "Because:\n\n1. The stock app uses it so Vanced uses it too.\n2. It only installs the languages you specify to reduce storage consumption.\n3. It has the only version of core APK that your device requires.\n\nOf course, the Vanced Manager or developers can convert it to a normal, single APK file, but we are so lazy to do it. You just need to get along with what we have...\n\nDon't worry though, Vanced Manager does all the hard work for you so just tap on the `Install` button."
